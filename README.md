# Par
This repository contains the source code for the Par compiler and standard
libraries. If you're looking for tutorials, documentation, installation
instructions, etc. please refer to the [Par website](https://par-lang.org).

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, let us know in our [Gitter
channel](https://gitter.im/par-lang/par)! There are many ways to help out, from
tooling to language design to standard libraries:

- Write a Par plugin for your favorite editor to support syntax highlighting,
  marking compiler errors, running tests on save, etc.
- Improve pattern matching by adding support for structs and maps.
- Add syntatic sugar to insert values into a set (e.g. `#[a, b | set]`) or add
  key-value pairs to a map (e.g. `{ a => b, c => d | map }`).
- Write standard library modules for e.g. HTTP, crypto, Date/Time, etc. by
  leaning on existing OTP libraries.
- Report any bugs you find and help improve documentation where you think it's
  confusing.
- Write guides or tutorials on how to use Par to build applications.

This is a small sample of things you could work on. Get in touch if you're
interested; we'd love to have you help! We're also searching for members to add
to our core team, and getting involved early is the best track for this.

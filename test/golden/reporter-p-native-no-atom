A colon can either be used to separate an expression and its corresponding type
signature, such as in 1 : Int, or to call a native erlang function, such as in
@erlang:length([]). It looks like you're trying to do the latter here, but you
must specify a literal atom, like @erlang or @lists, before the colon:

3: erlang:length([])
         ^

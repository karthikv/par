Unterminated string literal. You can use \n for a newline character or use \ at 
the end of a line to continue the string literal on the next line. Note that 
the latter also inserts a newline character. If you want to concat multiple 
strings, use the ++ operator:
3: "hello, 
4: world"

Unterminated string literal:
4: world"
        ^
